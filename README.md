## Shop Backend

Just a simple (really simple) shop backend in Rust to validate how mature the ecosystem is for web development. Hence, all techonologies used are Rust centric, even the frontend, using some html templating crate.

This repository does not aim to create a full e-commence backend with many complex features and validations.
